# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Richard", last_name: "Nixon", email: "rnixon@gmail.com", phone_number: "444-667-9878")
# contact.save
# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Babe", last_name: "Ruth", email: "babyruth@gmail.com", phone_number: "333-647-5578")
